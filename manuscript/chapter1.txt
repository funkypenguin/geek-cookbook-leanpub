# Introduction

Hello world,

I'm [David](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/contact/).

I've spent 20+ years working with technology. My current role is **Senior Infrastructure Architect** at [Prophecy Networks Ltd](http://www.prophecy.net.nz) in New Zealand, with a specific interest in networking, systems, open-source, and business management.

I've had a [book published](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/phplist-2-email-campaign-manager/), and I [blog](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/blog/) on topics that interest me.

## Why Funky Penguin?

My first "real" job, out of high-school, was working the IT helpdesk in a typical pre-2000 organization in South Africa. I enjoyed experimenting with Linux, and cut my teeth by replacing the organization's Exchange 5.5 mail platform with a 15-site [qmail-ldap](http://www.nrg4u.com/) cluster, with [amavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amavis) virus-scanning.

One of our suppliers asked me to quote to do the same for their organization. With nothing to loose, and half-expecting to be turned down, I quoted a generous fee, and chose a cheeky company name. The supplier immediately accepted my quote, and the name ("_Funky Penguin_") stuck.

## Technical Documentation

During the same "real" job above, I wanted to deploy [jabberd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberd14), for internal instant messaging within the organization, and as a means to control the sprawl of ad-hoc instant-messaging among staff, using ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo Messenger.

To get management approval to deploy, I wrote a logger (with web UI) for jabber conversations ([Bandersnatch](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/project/bandersnatch/)), and a [75-page user manual](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/jajc-manual/) (in [Docbook XML](http://www.docbook.org/) for a spunky Russian WinXP jabber client, [JAJC](http://jajc.jrudevels.org/).

Due to my contributions to [phpList](http://www.phplist.com), I was approached in 2011 by [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com), to [write a book](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/phplist-2-email-campaign-manager) about using PHPList.

##README

1. "Recipies" are sorted by degree of geekiness required to complete them. Relatively straightforward projects are "beginner", more complex projects are "intermediate", and the really fun ones are "advanced".
2. Each recipe contains enough detail in a single page to take a project to completion.
3. When there are optional add-ons/integrations possible to a project (i.e., the addition of "smart LED bulbs" to Home Assistant), this will be reflected as a sub-page of the main project.
